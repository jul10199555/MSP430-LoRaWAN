# MSP430-LoRaWAN
Integration of LoRaWAN using MSP430FR59XXLP Microcontrollers
-------

The goal of this repo is to optimize the code of a LoRaWAN wireless sensor node to achieve a lower power consumption, regulate LoRa TX / RX power, 
to add bidirectional (Uplink & acknowledge/downlink) communication capabilities on gateway & sensor node and the integration of pH, conductivity, temperature, 
humidity and atmospheric pressure sensors.
